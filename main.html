                <summary>
                    Dom Cobb is a skilled thief who specializes in extraction - stealing secrets from deep within the subconscious during the dream state. His rare ability has made him a coveted player in the treacherous new world of corporate espionage, but it has also made him an international fugitive and cost him everything he has ever loved. Now Cobb is being offered a chance at redemption through one last job that could give him his life back, but only if he can accomplish the seemingly impossible: inception. Instead of stealing an idea, he must plant one deep within someone's mind, navigating through multiple layers of dreams within dreams.
